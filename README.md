# Healthcare Access Analysis

A comprehensive data science project analyzing healthcare access patterns in underserved communities to optimize clinic resource allocation.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data science workflow applied to a social impact problem: predicting clinic capacity needs in rural and underserved areas.

### Skills Demonstrated
- Python data science stack (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Working with messy, real-world data
- Feature engineering and exploratory data analysis
- Machine learning model development and evaluation
- Translating technical results into actionable insights

### Problem Approach
1. **Stakeholder-focused**: Understanding decision-makers' needs and constraints
2. **Domain-driven**: Integrating healthcare expertise into analysis
3. **Iterative methodology**: Building from simple to complex models
4. **Actionable insights**: Providing specific, implementable recommendations

## Key Findings
- Population and elderly demographics are strongest predictors of clinic demand
- Distance to hospitals creates significant access barriers
- Seasonal patterns (flu season) increase demand by 15-20%
- Uninsured populations rely heavily on clinic services

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest, Linear Regression
- **Development**: Git, Jupyter Notebook workflow
